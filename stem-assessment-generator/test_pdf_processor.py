What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Decentralization: No single point of control
‚Ä¢ Immutability: Records cannot be altered once written
‚Ä¢ Transparency: All transactions are visible to network participants
‚Ä¢ Consensus: Network agreement on transaction validity

Hash Functions:
Cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 ensure data integrity. Each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain of records.

Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain

Proof of Work (PoW):
Miners compete to solve computationally difficult puzzles. The first to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block and receive a reward. Used by Bitcoin.

Proof of Stake (PoS):
Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on their stake in the network. More energy-efficient than PoW. Used by Ethereum 2.0.

Smart Contracts:
Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met. Enable complex applications on blockchain platforms.

Common Misconceptions:
‚Ä¢ Blockchain is only for cryptocurrency
‚Ä¢ All blockchains are public
‚Ä¢ Blockchain is completely anonymous""")
